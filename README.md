# Badminton Video Analysis

## Purpose

Badminton is a game of anticipation and preparation just as much as it is a game of physical strength and speed. Studying your opponent's favorite shots in advance can give you the split-second advantage you need to win the point. The traditional way of getting this advantage was to watch your opponent's shot selection observantly throughout the tournament but nowadays free data is available on every professional player on YouTube. With the computer vision techniques of the modern day, machine learning and statistics can potentially improve player's preparation and training. As someone who loves the game of badminton, my goal is to research computer vision techniques for improving it. However, I believe that machine learning will have a major impact on every sport and can be used to help us reach our physical potential.

This repo aims to create datasets and models that can be used to conduct statistical analysis on the game of badminton. I intend to make all of my code easily usable and customizable so that anyone interested can use their own methods on these datasets. 

## Poses

Pose detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and tracks key points on a human body to estimate posture and movement using machine learning. I got the idea to use Poses in this project: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/paulliu/badminton/.
