{"predictions":[{"label":"13_Long_Serve","confidence":0.62,"evidence":"From ServeLine context a serve is most likely. The right_arm shows a larger, more continuous preparation-to-hit pattern than a short serve: early frames move from P300_90 → P330_150/210 (clear setup/backswing), then a pronounced distal ‘snap’ through the 330°↔0° boundary around frames ~13–16 (e.g., P210_330 → P300_0), followed by a longer follow-through with the forearm down/around (e.g., P330_270). The right_torso also shifts from ~P60_90 to ~P90_60 and later ~P120_90, suggesting more body involvement than the mostly-static torso expected in a short serve. Confidence is moderate because the sequence is long and contains additional arm/torso changes after the likely contact moment, which adds ambiguity."}]}

The main action looks like a wrist/forearm-led push/roll with limited shoulder travel: right_arm upper stays near ~300° while the forearm rotates through ~330→0° (frames ~33–49: P_300_330 to P_300_0), consistent with a controlled short serve rather than a long-serve backswing + big torso/leg drive.
