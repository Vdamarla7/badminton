Using the 2B parameter model we will: 
    find the objects
    the bounding boxes for the 2 people that have a center closest to the center of the court
    we will find the keypoints for each of the bounding boxes
        A will be the bounding box for the top person
        B will be the bounding box for the bottom person

The data structure is going to be: 
    Image name
    Image Location
    Frames[]
        Frame
            A bounding box
            B bounding box
            A keypoints
            B keypoints
    Analysis on the bounding boxes and the keypoints

Each line will include: 
    Frame
    ABBOX: 
    BBBOX: 
    AKEYPPINTS: 
    BKEYPOINTS:
